Python is a requirement for the marking script to function.
On the computer you wish to use to upload your assignments you need to have OCaml installed, Python installed and the requests module installed for Python.

The lab machines already contain a copy of Python. To install 'requests' for the marking script to use, please run the following commands on the terminal. 

git clone git://github.com/kennethreitz/requests.git
cd requests 
python setup.py install --user
