(Continuation of Week 8 Exercise 1)

Write a function 

subst : int -> string -> exp -> exp

which substitutes an integer value (given as first argument) for all occurrences of a variable (given as second argument) in an expression (given as third argument). For example (given as strings):

    if string_of_exp e = "(let y=(x+1) in (x+y))" then string_of_exp (subst 8 "x" e) = "(let y=(8+1) in (8+y))"

    if string_of_exp e = "(let x=1 in (x*(3+3)))" then string_of_exp (subst 7 "x" e) = "(let x=1 in (7*(3+3)))"
