Write an OCaml function interleave: 'a list list -> 'a list that takes as argument a list of lists of the same length and "interleaves" them into a single least by picking the heads of each list, then the second element and so on.

Example:

    interleave [[1; 2; 3]; [4; 5; 6]; [7; 8; 9]] = [1; 4; 7; 2; 5; 8; 3; 6; 9]
