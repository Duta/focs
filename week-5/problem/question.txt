Consider the llama game. You are given the type of llamas and the type of moves

	type llama = R | L | O

where R is a right-facing llama, L a left-facing llama, and O a llama-sized gap. The position is a llama list. The leading and trailing Os can be ignored.

Your task is to write a function 

	has_solution : llama list -> bool

which returns true if and only if there is some sequence of valid moves from the given position to any winning position. For example

	has_solution [R; R; O; L; L] = true

	has_solution [R; R; L; L] = false

Hints: 

    Try to adapt the has_path function from lecture 12.
    To avoid searching an infinite number of nodes consider the convergent version of the game (Week 1 Problem). 
    There are no restrictions as to what libraries and OCaml features you can use in solving this.
