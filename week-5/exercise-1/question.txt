Consider the Llama game. For the purpose of this problem a final (winning) position in the game is when all right-facing llamas are past all the left facing llamas.

You are given the type of llamas:

    type llama = R | L | O

where R is a right-facing llama, L a left-facing llama, and O a llama-sized gap. The position is a llama list.

Your task is to write a function winning : llama list -> bool which returns true if a position is winning and false otherwise.

For example:

 - winning [R; O; L] = false
 - winning [O; O; L; L; R; O; R; O] = true
